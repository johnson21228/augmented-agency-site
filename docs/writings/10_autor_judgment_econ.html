    <h1>Judgment as a Scarce, Time-Formed Resource (David Autor)</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>David Autor’s work on labor economics distinguishes tasks from judgment. Tasks can often be automated; judgment resists codification because it is time-formed and context-dependent.</p>

<p>Automation displaces tasks, not judgment—but it often erodes the conditions judgment requires.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Tasks Versus Judgment</h2>

<p>Tasks are specifiable units of work. Judgment integrates, prioritizes, and adapts tasks under uncertainty.</p>

<p>Judgment appears where rules end.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Codifiability and Time</h2>

<p>Tasks become automatable when knowledge can be written down.</p>

<p>Judgment cannot, because it is formed through exposure, error, and feedback over time.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Displacement Without Support</h2>

<p>Automation often removes the scaffolding through which judgment was exercised.</p>

<p>Demand for judgment rises while opportunities to form it shrink.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Polarization and Continuity Loss</h2>

<p>Middle-skill roles historically supported judgment formation.</p>

<p>Their erosion fragments experience and undermines continuity.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Complementarity Without Continuity</h2>

<p>Human-machine complementarity does not preserve judgment unless continuity is maintained.</p>

<p>Intermittent oversight degrades judgment.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Structural Implication</h2>

<p>Judgment is a form of capital that accumulates slowly and decays when unused.</p>

<p>Systems that optimize tasks while fragmenting experience preserve efficiency while eroding agency.</p>

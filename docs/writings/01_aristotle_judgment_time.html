    <h1>Judgment as a Time-Formed Capacity (Aristotle)</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>Aristotle provides the earliest rigorous account of judgment as a capacity that exists only through time. In the <em>Nicomachean Ethics</em> and the <em>Physics</em>, judgment is not treated as a rule-based procedure or a momentary act of evaluation. It is understood as <em>phronēsis</em>—practical wisdom—formed through experience and exercised in contingent situations.</p>

<p>Judgment, for Aristotle, is inseparable from lived continuity. It cannot be acquired instantly, specified in advance, or reconstructed from outcomes.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Judgment and the Limits of Rules</h2>

<p>Aristotle distinguishes <em>phronēsis</em> from both <em>epistēmē</em> (theoretical knowledge) and <em>technē</em> (productive skill). Unlike <em>epistēmē</em>, judgment does not concern necessary truths. Unlike <em>technē</em>, it does not admit of instruction by rule.</p>

<p>Practical situations are variable and irreducibly particular. Because judgment concerns action within such situations, it cannot be encoded as a finite procedure. Rules presuppose repeatability; judgment presupposes exposure to variation over time.</p>

<p>To mistake judgment for rule-following is to flatten time into form.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Experience as a Structural Requirement</h2>

<p>Aristotle famously notes that young people may excel in mathematics but lack practical wisdom because “experience is the fruit of years.” This is not a sociological observation but a structural claim.</p>

<p>Experience is not the accumulation of facts. It is the transformation of perception through repeated engagement. The experienced agent does not merely recall past cases; they see the present differently because of them.</p>

<p>Judgment resides in this altered perception, not at the point of decision alone.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Time, Motion, and Action</h2>

<p>In the <em>Physics</em>, Aristotle defines time as the number of motion with respect to before and after. Time is not a container but a structure arising from change.</p>

<p>Human action unfolds within this structure. Practical reasoning must track motion, tendency, and direction—not static states. Judgment therefore requires the ability to situate the present within an unfolding arc.</p>

<p>This capacity cannot be extracted from snapshots of action. It exists only through traversal.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Against Outcome-Based Evaluation</h2>

<p>Aristotle distinguishes acting well from merely producing good results. Success may occur by chance; judgment cannot.</p>

<p>Judgment concerns the manner of choosing: acting for the right reasons, in the right way, at the right time. Outcomes alone do not reveal whether judgment was present.</p>

<p>Judgment is path-dependent. It can be recognized only through continuity of practice.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Structural Implication</h2>

<p>Judgment is not an operation performed at a moment. It is a capacity formed through sustained engagement with changing circumstances.</p>

<p>Any system that treats judgment as a detachable decision procedure preserves results while erasing judgment itself.</p>

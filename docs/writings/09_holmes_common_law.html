    <h1>Legal Judgment as Historical Accretion (Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr.)</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>Holmes presents legal judgment as a historically accumulated capacity rather than deductive rule application. “The life of the law has not been logic; it has been experience.”</p>

<p>Judgment precedes rules. Rules summarize it.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Law as Experience</h2>

<p>Legal doctrines emerge from repeated encounters with cases. Rules are abstractions extracted afterward.</p>

<p>Judgment cannot be reduced to formal logic.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Precedent as Continuity</h2>

<p>Precedent preserves trajectory, not formula. Judges situate cases within evolving lines of decision.</p>

<p>Judgment consists in navigating continuity under change.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Institutional Memory</h2>

<p>Legal judgment is collective. Courts preserve continuity across generations.</p>

<p>This memory is not a database but a shared sensibility.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Irreversibility</h2>

<p>Legal development is path-dependent. Each judgment carries the weight of prior ones.</p>

<p>Judgment moves forward by accretion.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Structural Implication</h2>

<p>Judgment cannot be preserved by codification alone. It requires preservation of historical continuity.</p>

<p>Systems that record outcomes while erasing sequence preserve law while losing judgment.</p>

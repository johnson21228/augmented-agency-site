    <h1>Duration and the Irreversibility of Judgment (Henri Bergson)</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>Henri Bergson’s philosophy centers on the distinction between lived time (<em>durée</em>) and spatialized time. In <em>Time and Free Will</em> and later works, Bergson argues that treating time as a sequence of discrete units distorts cognition at its core. Judgment, on his account, depends on duration: a qualitative continuity in which past, present, and future interpenetrate.</p>

<p>Judgment cannot survive the reduction of time to measurable instants.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Duration Versus Spatialized Time</h2>

<p>Bergson rejects the conception of time as a line of identical moments. This conception, while useful for measurement, imports spatial reasoning into temporal experience.</p>

<p>Duration is lived time. Moments are not juxtaposed; they permeate one another. The present is thick with the past, and the future is already nascent in the direction of the flow.</p>

<p>Judgment occurs only within this continuity.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Judgment Against Choice Among States</h2>

<p>Bergson distinguishes genuine judgment from the selection among pre-existing options. The latter presupposes that possibilities are fully formed in advance.</p>

<p>In lived experience, judgment is creative. The situation does not present a fixed menu. The response emerges as the situation unfolds, shaped by accumulated experience.</p>

<p>Judgment is formation, not selection.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Accumulation of the Past</h2>

<p>In duration, the past is preserved not as stored images but as pressure and orientation. Each moment carries the entire past in transformed form.</p>

<p>Judgment depends on this accumulation. What is perceived as relevant or urgent depends on how the past has been integrated into the present.</p>

<p>No amount of information can substitute for this continuity.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Irreversibility and Freedom</h2>

<p>Duration is irreversible. Once lived, it cannot be replayed. This irreversibility grounds freedom: action is neither mechanically determined nor arbitrary.</p>

<p>Judgment expresses the entire history of the agent at a moment of becoming. It cannot be reconstructed from inputs and outputs.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Against Measurement as a Model of Mind</h2>

<p>Measurement freezes what is fluid. It replaces continuity with coordinates.</p>

<p>While analysis may require such freezing, judgment does not survive it. Judgment lives in transitions and qualitative shifts that measurement smooths away.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Structural Implication</h2>

<p>Judgment cannot be preserved by spatializing time. Systems that reduce cognition to discrete states preserve calculation while erasing judgment.</p>

<p>Judgment exists only where duration is preserved as duration.</p>

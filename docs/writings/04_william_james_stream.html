    <h1>Judgment in the Stream of Consciousness (William James)</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>William James rejects atomistic models of thought and replaces them with continuity. In <em>The Principles of Psychology</em>, consciousness is described as a stream: continuous, flowing, and irreversible.</p>

<p>Judgment arises within this stream. It is not an operation performed upon mental contents but a modulation of an ongoing process.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Against Discrete Mental States</h2>

<p>James rejects the “psychologist’s fallacy” of mistaking analytic categories for lived experience. Thought does not arrive in packets.</p>

<p>If thought is continuous, judgment cannot be discrete.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Continuity and Meaning</h2>

<p>Meaning arises from relations sustained across time. A present thought is intelligible only because of what precedes and follows it.</p>

<p>Judgment depends on this relational continuity.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Attention and Habit</h2>

<p>Attention shapes the stream over time. What is attended to becomes salient; what is neglected fades.</p>

<p>Judgment expresses a history of attention and habit.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Irreversibility</h2>

<p>The stream moves forward. Once a judgment has occurred, the conditions that produced it no longer exist in the same form.</p>

<p>Judgment cannot be replayed or reconstructed.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Structural Implication</h2>

<p>Judgment does not reside in stored content. It resides in continuity.</p>

<p>Any system that preserves conclusions while discarding the stream preserves information while erasing judgment.</p>

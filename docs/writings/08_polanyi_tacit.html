    <h1>Tacit Continuity and Personal Knowledge (Michael Polanyi)</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>Michael Polanyi argues that judgment depends on tacit knowing: forms of understanding that cannot be fully articulated. In <em>Personal Knowledge</em>, he shows that judgment is personal, continuous, and time-formed.</p>

<p>We know more than we can tell.</p>

<hr />

<h2>The Tacit Dimension</h2>

<p>Judgment relies on integrations that guide perception and action without being explicit.</p>

<p>These integrations form through time and cannot be transferred instantaneously.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Subsidiary and Focal Awareness</h2>

<p>Judgment operates through subsidiary awareness supporting focal action.</p>

<p>This background is reshaped continuously through experience.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Personal Participation</h2>

<p>Judgment involves commitment and responsibility. It cannot be detached from the knower without loss.</p>

<p>Personal does not mean subjective; it means time-formed.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Skill and Apprenticeship</h2>

<p>Expert judgment arises through prolonged practice and correction.</p>

<p>Rules cannot substitute for this continuity.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Against Formalization</h2>

<p>Attempts to formalize tacit knowledge often destroy it by shifting attention away from integration.</p>

<p>Judgment resists extraction.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Structural Implication</h2>

<p>Judgment cannot be preserved by explicit knowledge alone. It depends on tacit continuity formed over time.</p>

<p>Preserve statements without participation, and judgment vanishes.</p>

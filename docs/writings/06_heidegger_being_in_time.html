    <h1>Being-in-Time as the Ground of Judgment (Martin Heidegger)</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>In <em>Being and Time</em>, Heidegger argues that temporality is not an attribute added to cognition but the condition that makes understanding and judgment possible. Judgment is not an evaluative act applied to representations. It is an expression of <em>being-in-time</em>.</p>

<p>Judgment arises only because human existence is temporally structured.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Being-in-the-World</h2>

<p>Heidegger rejects the model of a detached subject evaluating objects. Human existence (<em>Dasein</em>) is always already <em>being-in-the-world</em>.</p>

<p>Judgment does not occur from outside situations. It occurs from within them.</p>

<p>Detached evaluation is secondary.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Temporality as Structure</h2>

<p>Heidegger describes human existence as a unity of:
- thrownness (past),
- projection (future),
- involvement (present).</p>

<p>These are not stages but aspects of one temporal structure.</p>

<p>Judgment is grounded in this structure. To judge is to take a stand within a field shaped by past commitments and future possibilities.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Understanding as Anticipatory</h2>

<p>Understanding is fundamentally future-oriented. Situations are encountered in terms of what they afford or threaten.</p>

<p>Judgment is therefore prospective, not retrospective. It orients action rather than evaluating completed states.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Care and Non-Neutrality</h2>

<p>Heidegger identifies <em>care</em> as the basic structure of existence. Existence matters to itself over time.</p>

<p>Judgment is therefore never neutral. It is bound up with concern and consequence without becoming arbitrary.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Irreversibility</h2>

<p>Existential time is irreversible. Each judgment alters the horizon within which future judgments occur.</p>

<p>Judgment cannot be replayed or reconstructed.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Structural Implication</h2>

<p>Judgment cannot be preserved by storing representations alone. It depends on preserving the temporal structure of being-in-the-world.</p>

<p>Flatten time, and judgment collapses into calculation.</p>

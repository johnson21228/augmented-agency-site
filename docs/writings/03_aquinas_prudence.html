    <h1>Prudence as Stabilized Temporal Discernment (Aquinas)</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>Thomas Aquinas synthesizes Aristotle’s practical wisdom with Augustine’s interior temporality into a rigorous account of judgment as <em>prudence</em> (<em>prudentia</em>). Prudence is not calculation, instinct, or rule application. It is a stabilized capacity for right judgment in action, formed through time.</p>

<p>Judgment, in Aquinas’s account, depends on continuity of memory, foresight, and character.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Prudence as Practical Reason</h2>

<p>Aquinas defines prudence as <em>recta ratio agibilium</em>: right reason about things to be done. Prudence concerns action in contingent situations and therefore operates under uncertainty.</p>

<p>Unlike speculative reason, prudence concerns particulars. Particulars are known only through experience.</p>

<p>Judgment cannot be abstracted from temporal engagement.</p>

<hr />

<h2>The Integral Parts of Prudence</h2>

<p>Aquinas identifies integral parts of prudence, including:
- memory,
- understanding,
- foresight,
- circumspection,
- caution.</p>

<p>Each is explicitly temporal. Together they form an arc from past through present toward future.</p>

<p>Judgment emerges only when this arc is intact.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Memory and Moral Continuity</h2>

<p>Prudential memory is not recall of facts but truthful retention of lived experience. It is shaped by practice and habituation.</p>

<p>False memory corrupts judgment by distorting continuity.</p>

<p>Prudence is cumulative and irreversible.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Foresight and Direction</h2>

<p>Prudence is future-oriented without being predictive. Foresight is the ability to sense where present action tends.</p>

<p>Judgment is directional rather than calculative. It moves along a trajectory.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Against Outcome-Based Judgment</h2>

<p>A prudent action may fail; an imprudent one may succeed. Judgment is evaluated by discernment at the time of action, not by results.</p>

<p>Judgment resides in seeing and choosing under uncertainty.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Structural Implication</h2>

<p>Judgment cannot be preserved by recording decisions alone. It requires preservation of the temporal structures through which discernment is formed.</p>

<p>Prudence is continuity made reliable.</p>

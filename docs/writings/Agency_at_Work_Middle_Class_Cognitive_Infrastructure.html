    <h1>Agency at Work: Why the Middle Class Needs Cognitive Infrastructure</h1>

<p>For more than a generation, the erosion of the American middle class has been treated as an economic inevitability—the combined result of globalization, automation, and skill-biased technological change. This framing obscures a more precise structural failure: the progressive externalization of human judgment from everyday work. As MIT economist David Autor has observed (http://www.nber.org/papers/w32140), middle-class occupations historically existed where individuals exercised discretion, responsibility, and situated expertise, not merely where they executed predefined tasks. Artificial intelligence now arrives at a moment when this loss of judgment could either be completed or reversed. Whether AI becomes a force that further hollows out economic agency, or one that helps restore it, depends not on productivity gains or retraining initiatives, but on whether reasoning, memory, and decision authority remain anchored in the individual over time.</p>

<p>The decline of middle-class work did not begin with artificial intelligence. It began earlier, with forms of automation and organizational design that separated execution from judgment. As workflows were decomposed, standardized, and optimized, discretion migrated upward—into management systems, software platforms, and institutional processes. Workers retained activity but lost authority. What remained were jobs defined by compliance, throughput, and supervision rather than expertise. The economic consequences of this shift are well documented. Less visible, but more consequential, was the erosion of cognitive ownership: the loss of responsibility for deciding what mattered, when, and why.</p>

<p>Contemporary AI systems risk repeating this pattern under a different name. Much of what is presented as “augmentation” in fact preserves the same structural asymmetry. Copilots, recommendation engines, and workflow-embedded intelligence increase efficiency while centralizing judgment elsewhere. They assist with outputs but do not preserve reasoning continuity. The worker interacts with intelligence, but does not accumulate it. Over time, context, memory, and inference migrate into systems that persist independently of any individual. The human becomes an operator of intelligence rather than its owner.</p>

<p>This distinction—between operating intelligence and owning judgment—is decisive for the future of middle-class work. Judgment is not a momentary act. It is a temporal phenomenon. It depends on continuity: the accumulation of context, experience, error, revision, and responsibility across time. When this continuity is broken—when memory is externalized, reasoning is fragmented, or decisions are mediated entirely through systems—discretion collapses, even if task complexity increases. No amount of assistance can substitute for the loss of internalized reasoning continuity.</p>

<p>The central claim of this essay is that judgment cannot be preserved through tools alone. It requires cognitive infrastructure that maintains continuity of reasoning within the human agent. Such infrastructure does not merely store information or retrieve answers. It preserves the conditions under which judgment can compound: stable reference points, persistent context, and responsibility for decisions made and revised over time. Without this continuity, intelligence becomes episodic and disposable. With it, expertise deepens and agency endures.</p>

<p>Seen in this light, the challenge facing the middle class is not primarily one of skills or wages. It is a question of cognitive ownership. When reasoning is externalized into enterprise systems, institutional memory, or opaque models, individuals lose the ability to accumulate expertise that travels with them across roles, tools, and contexts. Their economic position becomes contingent, their judgment replaceable. Conversely, when reasoning continuity is preserved at the individual level, expertise becomes durable, portable, and resistant to commoditization.</p>

<p>This requirement points toward a new class of infrastructure. Intelligent Augmented Memory (IAM) names an approach in which continuity, context, and reasoning remain internal to the individual rather than displaced into tools or institutions. IAM is not a productivity system or a copilot layer. It is cognitive infrastructure designed to preserve judgment as a human-held asset across time, roles, and technologies. Its significance lies not in what it automates, but in what it refuses to externalize.</p>

<p>If artificial intelligence is to support the reemergence of durable middle-class work, it must be designed around this invariant. Human judgment must remain the primary locus of continuity. Memory, inference, and context must compound inside the individual, not merely around them. This requires treating cognitive infrastructure as economic infrastructure: as foundational to agency as property rights or professional accreditation.</p>

<p>Absent this shift, AI will follow the path of prior automation. It will increase productivity while narrowing the space for discretion. It will create new tasks while dissolving authority. And it will accelerate the concentration of judgment in systems that individuals use but do not control. The result will not be technological unemployment, but something quieter and more persistent: a workforce that works more efficiently while owning less of its own thinking.</p>

<p>The future of the middle class will not be determined by how intelligent our systems become. It will be determined by where intelligence is allowed to live, accumulate, and endure. Without cognitive infrastructure that preserves human judgment over time, artificial intelligence will complete a process already underway—one that replaces agency with access, and discretion with optimization. Reversing that trajectory requires more than better tools. It requires restoring continuity to the human at work.</p>

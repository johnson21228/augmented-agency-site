    <h1>MAKING COGNITION LEGIBLE</h1>

<h2>Personal Continuity in Semantic Space</h2>

<p>Thinking unfolds through time. A problem is not solved in a moment, but worked on across returns, interruptions, revisions, and constraint. What persists is not a set of conclusions, but a path of language use shaped by a single human’s attention and judgment.</p>

<p>That path is personal.</p>

<p>It is formed by one human’s sequence of expressions, questions, revisions, and returns. Its ordering is defined by that person’s lived time. Its structure reflects how meaning was actually navigated, not how it might later be explained. This continuity of personal language use is a valuable resource because it preserves being-in-time: the ability to continue rather than restart.</p>

<p>When this continuity is lost, thinking must be reconstructed. Summaries, explanations, and coherence attempt to stand in for position, but they place the human outside the work, looking back at artifacts rather than re-entering the path. What disappears is orientation: where one was, what remained constrained, and what wanted to come to next.</p>

<p>Continuity preserves that orientation.</p>

<p>Because language use occurs in semantic space, a personal continuity path is not merely temporal. It is embedded in meaning. As the path extends, it takes shape: revisits collapse time, distant moments become conceptually adjacent, and constraints propagate across the whole. The result is a personal semantic space structured by time.</p>

<p>This shape is held by a substrate. Meaning is not imposed there. Meaning is given by the human who navigates it—through their choice of coordinates, metric, and perspective. The same preserved continuity can be read differently over time without being rewritten, because the shape itself remains intact.</p>

<p>The map is what makes this resource usable.</p>

<p>A continuity map does not explain thought. It allows a human to locate themselves within their own path through time and meaning. It supports multiple perspectives—along the path, within a local neighborhood, or across the global shape—without breaking continuity or forcing reconstruction. Perspective becomes a choice, not a rupture.</p>

<p>This is not about producing cognition. Imagination, attention, and meaning remain human. They are exercised, not generated. What the map provides is durable access to the conditions under which they operate: continuity of personal language use, preserved as a navigable structure.</p>

<p>Because the input is personal and the usage is personal, the resulting semantic space is irreducibly personal. It cannot be averaged, generalized, or transferred without losing what makes it powerful. It is not knowledge in the abstract. It is a lived trajectory.</p>

<p>The core claim is simple:</p>

<p>Personal language-use continuity is a powerful resource.
A map that preserves and exposes it allows a human to remain in time with their own thinking.</p>

<p>That is what it means to make cognition legible.</p>

    <h1>Judgment as Reflection-in-Action (Donald Schön)</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>Donald Schön examines how professionals judge in practice under conditions of uncertainty. In <em>The Reflective Practitioner</em>, he shows that judgment is exercised <em>within</em> action through a process he calls reflection-in-action.</p>

<p>Judgment is enacted, not applied.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Limits of Technical Rationality</h2>

<p>Technical rationality assumes problems are well-defined and solvable by rule application.</p>

<p>Schön shows that real practice involves indeterminate, unstable situations that resist formalization.</p>

<p>Judgment must occur as situations unfold.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Reflection-in-Action</h2>

<p>Reflection-in-action is thinking while doing. It is an ongoing adjustment of action in response to feedback.</p>

<p>Judgment emerges from this temporal sequence, not from a single evaluative moment.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Knowing-in-Practice</h2>

<p>Much professional judgment relies on tacit knowing embedded in action.</p>

<p>This knowing is formed through repeated engagement over time and reshapes perception itself.</p>

<p>Judgment is path-dependent.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Surprise and Reframing</h2>

<p>Surprise interrupts routine action and calls judgment into play.</p>

<p>The practitioner reframes the situation in real time, guided by experience rather than rules.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Against Retrospective Rationalization</h2>

<p>Post-hoc explanations impose coherence after the fact. They should not be confused with judgment as it occurred in action.</p>

<p>Judgment lives in trajectory, not narrative reconstruction.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Structural Implication</h2>

<p>Judgment cannot be preserved by recording plans or rationales alone. It requires preserving the temporal path of engagement.</p>

<p>Capture outcomes without paths, and judgment disappears.</p>
